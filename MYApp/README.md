# StampPad
### Version 0.0.1
### Project Status: Active
# Overview:

This is a desktop tool built in Java as a part of an ongoing effort to expand my coding skills, and get some fist hand experience using various tools and programming languages. Specifically I wanted to challenge myself to solve a problem and not just follow a tutorial.
 
StampPad aims to smooth out my morning login routine by providing a tool that presents you with your password and allows you to copy it.
